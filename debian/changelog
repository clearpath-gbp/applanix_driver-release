ros-hydro-applanix-bridge (0.0.5-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Typo in the imu angular velocity z component is fixed. All the required NED (/reference or /vehicle for Applanix) to ENU (/base_footprint or /base_link in ROS) frame conversions are applied to get correct Pose and twist data.
  * gams params, dmi params and some geometry params added to be configured correctly. some sample values are provided in the example.launch also added in this commit
  * launch file updated as auxiliary gnss to reference frame lever is not neeeded.
  * updated the launch file with correct installation parameters for applanix
  * Origin now includes the z dimension or altitude so that the odometry msgs are w.r.t. the current surface and not the sea level. quaternion assignment in tf broadcaster had a bug which is fixed now.
  * Fixing typo in publisher.py, we Transfrom != Transform

ros-hydro-applanix-bridge (0.0.4-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Removing diagnostic_msgs from find_package because it isn't needed at build, it's handled by the run_depends, and it makes the build servers cry.

ros-hydro-applanix-bridge (0.0.2-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Increased queue size to 5 since data smoke test fails otherwise
  * Added queue sizes on Publishers to make Indigo complain less
  * Added dependency on geodesy
  * Merged applanix_msgs with applanix_srvs and adapted the mapping.py
    script to generate all of the required elements. Updated the
    CMakeLists.txt for applanix_msgs to generate services and AllMsgs.
    Updated applanix_bridge for the changes.

ros-hydro-applanix-bridge (0.0.0-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Adding install targets
  * Replaced the gps_utm.py with a call to geodesy.utm. Should work, but not
    well tested.
  * Cleaned up the dependencies from applanix_bridge
  * Changing maintainer of the applanix modules to be me
  * Fixed package names in launch file
  * Removed a bunch of the chunky comments from the CMakeLists.txt for all
    of the sub projects.
  * Moved the smoke test into the applanix_bridge package.
    It seems to work. At the very least it passes, though it does spit out a
    bunch of warnings.
  * Moved mapping.py back to applanix_msgs because it's needed by
    applanix_bridge and it makes more sense for it to be there. Also updated
    applanix_bridge to use the new applanix_srvs package.
  * Updated applanix_msgs to generate messages so that applanix_bridge can
    use them.
  * Making applanix_bridge into a proper rospy package that you can run. Can
    now run things, though they fail because of the missing applanix_msgs.
    Also note that I've removed a bunch of the dependencies until I can
    figure out how to do those properly.
  * First stage of catkinizing: catkin metapackage, and consolidate the
    python stuff into applanix_bridge. Have yet to update the CMakeLists.txt
    for the applanix_bridge package to work properly. Also need a setup.py
  * Fixed translator for use in Hydro. Seems to work in testing on the Tango
    Tasmania platform.
  * Switch the translator to use separate genpy package.
  * Adding capture file and basic smoke test to driver.
  * Moving gps_utm file to correct package.
  * Added some minimal documentation to the manifests, moved publisher to its own package.
  * Adding code headers to everything.
  * Now publishing the origin of our UTM coordinates wrt. the UTM zone zero point
  * Small cleanup of unnecessary shebangs, etc.
  * Adding option to autoset a UTM origin
  * Added params for base gnss setup.
  * Adding COM port configuration
  * Adding translation node to convert Applanix messages into standard ROS messages
  * Stomped on merge changes. 'master' should now match 'work'.
  * Merge branch 'work'
  * rename applanix_ctl to applanix_generated_msgs
  * Auto-subscribe now working.
  * Add nav_mode messages every 5s to keep connection alive.
  * Working COM port params.
  * Initial support for services.
  * Last commit before refactoring to separate thread class per socket.
  * Add remaining groups, change the array serialization strategy.
  * First commit.
